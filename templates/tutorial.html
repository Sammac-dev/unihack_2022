        <p>
            Data science is a type of computer programming that involves working with data. Your data is a valuable resource and data scientists can help you
            extract insights and make predictions about the future, based on your past data.

        <p> 
            What we provide here at Prediction Pal is a simple platform for you to bring your data and experience the power of data science for yourself, without
            needing your own team to write a solution. With machine learning, the computer will take your data and apply an algorithm (calculations) to learn something based on your training dataset, and then use
            this new knowledge to make predictions on new data.

            <p>
                A dataset contains all your information, but we need a way to test our model so you can be confident in using it. When we train a model, we actually split the data into two parts, one 
                part of the data gets used to train a model, and the other part will be held back. Then, once the model is trained, we use this "new" data (something the model hasn't seen before), and 
                compare the answers it gets, with the answers we already had. Any differences can then be used to generate a score that tells you how good the model produced performs.

        <p>
            On the <a href="/train">training page</a>, you will upload your dataset that has the information you want to predict (label), as well as supporting information (features) you receive
            as part of your business. For example, you might want to predict number of customers (label) and you currently keep a record of time of transactions, day of the week, weather (features).
            In the training stage, you will upload your dataset that has the label and features. After telling us which part of the information you want to be
            able to predict, the dataset will be submitted to a machine learning algorithm to learn about your business and train a model.

        <div class="content-small"> 
        <h2> <span style="color:rgb(179, 50, 50) ;"> How does predicting work?</h2> </span>
        <p>
            A model is created after training is complete, this is a .pkl file. This model can then be used with future datasets you have to generate predictions. These future datasets just need
            to contain the exact same columns as your original dataset, and can be data you have collected, or data that you are testing a theory (for example, you can create data with features you want to predict
            their affect on your business would be).
